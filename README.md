### Technologies Used

Javascript, CSS, HTML

### Special Instructions

N/A

### Planning Details

Pre-Coding: Laid out wire frame which included title of game, game instructions, and a game field. The game field is where the game would take place and all stats would live here. Inside of the game field there would be 3 columns. The first and third column would include player A/B's card and win count. The second column would hold the score of the current game (player a, b, tie count).

Build: My objective in this field was to build my imagined wire frame. I strictly used HTML and CSS for this portion of the project. After I built out my imagined wire frame, I moved on to Javascript/DOM manipulation.

JS/DOMManipulation/Functions: My goal here was to lay out my needed variables and DOM hooks that I'd be using. After I did this, I then went on to build out the necessary functions (scoring, winning the game, etc.) to make a minimum viable product. After making the game functional enough to keep track of stats, I then moved back to CSS for basic layout changes to look more aesthetically pleasing.

CSS Edits: In this portion of coding, I wanted to start building out my theme which included a variation of military greens, bright red, and subtly transparent elements. I also wanted to fix my cards to not float to the lower bottom right of the screen. There were some other minor things like this that needed some slight adjustments. Then I went on to CSS animations and effects to give the page a nice touch.

Turn-In: At this point, I felt that the product was working well and it looked aesthetically appealing. There are some slight changes that may be made for additional animation but otherwise the product is finished.

### Remaining Bugs

At this point, there are no bugs that I have encountered.

### Features to add/wishlist

I would like to build a card flipping animation when drawing new cards.
